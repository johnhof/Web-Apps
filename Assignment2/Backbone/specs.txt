email users added to a schedule


	b)     Finalize a schedule.  For this option the maker will select an already existent schedule from his / her list of schedules.  Finalizing the schedule will do the following:
		
		i)      Count the number of users who have selected each available slot, and determine the slot with the greatest number of available users.  If there is a tie you may break it in an arbitrary way.
		
		ii)    Send an email to the list of users for the schedule indicating the chosen slot (date and time, nicely formatted).
